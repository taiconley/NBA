need a process to:
* find all games and game ids
* find all players and player ids
* parse box scores for a game id


to find game ids:

from nba_api.stats.endpoints import leaguegamefinder
# Query for games where the Celtics were playing
#gamefinder = leaguegamefinder.LeagueGameFinder(team_id_nullable=celtics_id)
gamefinder = leaguegamefinder.LeagueGameFinder()
# The first DataFrame of those returned is what we want.
games = gamefinder.get_data_frames()[0]
games.head()


to find a box score from a game id:
from nba_api.stats.endpoints import boxscoreadvancedv2
box_scores = boxscoreadvancedv2.BoxScoreAdvancedV2(game_id='0021800283')
box_scores.get_data_frames()[0].head()

to find the score of a game:
from nba_api.stats.endpoints import boxscoresummaryv2
